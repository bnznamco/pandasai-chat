# DATA ANALYSIS MODERN STACK

## Introduction 📚
This repository contains an example of a modern data analysis stack. The stack is composed of the following tools:

- **🚀 FastApi**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **🐼 Pandas**: A fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open-source data analysis and data manipulation library built on top of the Python programming language.
- **💬 PandasAI**: A library that provides a simple way to use machine learning models with Pandas DataFrames.
- **💫 Astro**: A modern frontend framework for building modern web applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## PandasAI 🐼💬

PandasAI is a library that provides a simple way to use machine learning models with Pandas DataFrames. It is built on top of the Pandas library and provides a simple interface for training and using machine learning models with Pandas DataFrames.
Thanks to PandasAI, this project provides to the user a chat-bot that can answer questions about the data. The chat-bot is built using the FastApi framework and the PandasAI library, and it is served as a web application using the Astro frontend framework.

## Quick Start 👷‍♂️

To run the project, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. Then, you can run the following commands:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start Astro frontend and FastApi backend. You can access the web application at http://localhost.

## Development 🛠️

To improve the project you can develop the frontend and the backend separately. 
All the frontend code is located in the `app` directory, and all the backend code is located in the `api` directory.
